# Beta CPU Diagnostics
{: .no_toc}

In this chapter, we'll focus on understanding and fixing problems in the Beta CPU, specifically looking at its datapath. We'll learn how to find out which datapath might be faulty using simple testing software to spot these issues, and figure out what code changes can help when parts of the system aren't working correctly. Our goal is about getting to know the Beta CPU datapath better and being able to fix it whenever possible. We will also learn how to handle **interrupts** in Beta datapath.


## [Interrupt Handling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T9MR8BSzt0&t=4563s)

**Interrupts**; as the name suggests is a response initiated by the CPU when an *error* or out-of-the-ordinary event occurs. 

$$\beta$$ interrupts come in **two** broad categories: **synchronous** and **asynchronous** interrupts. The key difference lies in their **timing** and **source**. 


1. **Synchronous Interrupts** (also known as **exceptions** or **software interrupts**) 
2. **Asynchronous Interrupts** (also known as **hardware interrupts**)

### Sampling the IRQ Signal
Notice the presence of the 1-bit register that **samples** the IRQ signal. This is  because. the IRQ signal actually an **asynchronous** interrupt trigger. In the later weeks, we will learn that **asynchronous** interrupts are generated by **other hardware devices** at *arbitrary* times with respect to the CPU clock signals. Therefore, we need another sequential logic device to **condition/synchronize** it such that it doesn't cause unwanted changes to the Control Unit in the middle of execution (in the middle of a clock cycle).  

This sampling device that receives the external `IRQ` signal allows the CPU to **sample** the input IRQ signal during the beginning of each instruction cycle, and will respond to the trigger only if the signal `IRQ` is asserted when sampling occurs.

The presence of the `CLK` signal in the Beta Datapath is written to remind you that the CPU should be able to *sample* the asynchronous `IRQ` signal  for each clock cycle. However, the heart of the Control Unit itself is combinational logic device (e.g: ROM) and not a sequential one.

### Synchronous Interrupts: Traps and Faults
Synchronous interrupts  (or sometimes known as **exception**, or **software interrupt**) interrupts that are generated by the CPU itself as a result of executing an instruction. They're also called software interrupts in some books. There are two types of synchronous interrupts:
1. **System Calls (Traps)**: A system call is a mechanism used by an application program to request service from the operating system. When a system call is made, the CPU switches to kernel mode to execute the operating system's code. This is often referred to as a "trap," as the application is effectively trapping into the operating system.
2. **Faults**: Faults are a type of exception raised by the CPU in response to error conditions, like a division by zero, invalid memory access, or other illegal operations. When a fault occurs, the CPU switches to kernel mode to handle the error, potentially terminating the offending process or taking other corrective actions.

**Traps** (*intentional*) and **faults** (*unintentional*) falls under the category of **synchronous interrupts** becauase they *are* synchronous with the CPU clk cycle. They are both the outcome of executing illegal instructions, i.e: when we supply an illegal `OPCODE`. Such illegal opcode does not correspond to any of the instructions defined in the ISA. The difference between the two are subtle: **traps** are intentional while **faults** are not.

The datapath that handles **trap/fault** (due to Illegal `OPCODE`) is as follows:

### Asynchronous Interrupts: Hardware Interrupts

Asynchronous Interrupts are interrupt signals that come from outside the CPU's current execution stream (not synchronysed with CPU clock). They are not directly tied to the execution of the current instruction sequence. These are signals sent to the processor from external devices, like a mouse or keyboard. When the CPU receives an interrupt, it temporarily halts the current execution thread, saves its state, and switches to kernel mode to handle the interrupt. After handling the interrupt, the CPU can return to the previous state and continue execution.

When hardware interrupts occur, it would require the CPU to "*pause*" the execution of the current program and **handle** the interrupt. 				
- At the beginning of each cycle, the CPU will always check whether `IRQ == 1`.  
- If `IRQ != 1`, the CPU will continue with normal execution. 
- If `IRQ == 1`, the CPU will *pause* the current execution and handle the interrupt request first (and eventually *resume* back the paused execution *after the interrupt handling is done*). 
 

The datapath that handles interrupt (due to asynchronous `IRQ` signal) is as follows:
<img src="/50002/assets/contentimage/beta/irq.png"  class="center_seventy"/>

### Differences in Datapath (simplified)
There's only **one** difference between the two types of interrupts (async vs sync): **the datapath at the PCSEL mux**. 
  
The PCSEL multiplexer's fourth and fifth input are called `ILLOP` and `XAdr`. In $$\beta$$ ISA,
-  `ILLOP` is set at `0x80000004`
-  `XAdr` is set at `0x80000008`

In this address resides the **entry point** of program that **handles** these events: illegal operation or hardware interrupts. 

### Control Signals for Interrupts
-  `ALUFN = --`
-  `WERF = 1`
- `BSEL = --`
-  `WDSEL = 00`
-  `WR = 0`
-  `RA2SEL = --`
-  `PCSEL`:
	-  `Illegal_Opcode ? 011 : 000`
	- `IRQ ? 100 : 000`
-  `ASEL = --` 
-  `WASEL = 1`

{: .note-title}
> Register XP (R30)
> 
> During interrupts, we set `WASEL = 1` and `WDSEL = 00` and `WERF = 1`. `PC+4` (supposed next instruction's address) is then **stored** at `Reg[XP]` (register 30, or `11110` in binary) so that we may **resume** the execution of this currently interrupted program once the interrupt has been **handled**. 


## Fault Detection and Diagnostics

In the realm of computer engineering, particularly when dealing with the intricacies of CPU hardware, the process of detecting and isolating faults within the CPU datapath is a **critical** task.  For instance, if the `RA2SEL` mux is **faulty**, then any `ST` instructions will be affected. 

Our objective is to create straightforward test programs specifically designed to identify particular faults. These programs are essential and should be capable of altering the state of the CPU and/or Memory in a distinct manner if such faults are present. Prior to initiating this process, it's crucial to have a clear understanding and reference of the control logic signals:

<img src="https://dropbox.com/s/2txzo6r3aeynguy/CU_2.png?raw=1"  class="center_fifty"  >

You should always begin with some **assumptions**, e.g: initial contents of all registers in the regfile are `0`, or that the Memory state from certain address range is of certain values (depending on the question), and then **design** some diagnostic program with a known end state of regfile and/or Memory. You then must run the program for a **fixed** amount of CPU `clk` cycle and observe the differences in the state of the regfile and/or Memory to what you should expect in a fully functional Beta CPU. 

### Example: `RA2SEL` mux is faulty

Suppose you suspected that the `RA2SEL` **mux** might be faulty: 
* The mux always "sees" that the `RA2SEL` signal given is always **stuck at `0`** 
* It cannot be `1` even if the Control Unit gives out `RA2SEL` signal of `1`

{: .note}
> 1.  The values in the `PC` / Registers in Regfile / Memory Unit will be *different* from a working Beta CPU if these programs were to be executed in this faulty Beta. 
> 2.  You can be 100% sure the discrepancy is caused by  `RA2SEL` mux being faulty and not any other faults (**isolation**)

Suppose we assume the initial content of all registers are `0` for this exercise, and that `PC` starts from `0`. This condition might differ depending on the question's scenario, so read them carefully. Since only `ST` instruction requires `RA2SEL` signal to be `1`, our program must utilise `ST` instructions. 

Consider following program **P1**, to be run at exactly 3 clk cycle (or until `HALT()`, whichever comes earlier):

```cpp
.=0x0000
LDR(constant, R0) 
ST(R0, answer, R31) 
HALT()  

constant: LONG(8) 

.=0xFFFC  
answer: LONG(4)
```

In a fully working Beta CPU, we should observe that constant `8` is stored in Memory address `0xFFFC` (`Mem[answer]`). However, if the `RA2SEL` mux is faulty as described above, we will see that the content of `R31` (which is `0`) will instead be stored into `Mem[answer]`. 

**Explanation**:
* The 16-bit signed constant of the `ST` instruction is `0xFFFC`
* This makes bit 15 to 11 to be `11111` (what we deems as 'Rb')
* If `RA2SEL` mux selects input `0` during this instruction, it will take the content of register `11111` (`R31`) to be stored at `Mem[answer]`
* Therefore we will observe `0` at `Mem[answer]` instead of `8`

Now consider the following program **P2** to be run at exactly 3 clk cycle (or until `HALT()`, whichever comes earlier):: 

```cpp
.=0x0000  
LDR(constant, R0) 
ST(R0, answer, R31) 
HALT()  

constant: LONG(8) 

.= 0x07FC
answer: LONG(4)
```

P2 will <span style="color:#ff791a; font-weight: bold;">not</span> be able to detect the faulty in `RA2SEL` mux because we would have the value `8` stored at `Mem[answer]` regardless of whether the `RA2SEL`  mux is faulty or not.

**Explanation**:
1. The 16-bit signed constant of the `ST` instruction is `0x07FC`, therefore bit 15 to 11 is now `00000` instead of `11111`
2. This means that we are **still** storing the content of `R0` to address `answer`
3. Since both bit 25 to 21 (Rc) and bit 15 to 11 (Rb) are **identical** (`00000`), it does not matter if the `RA2SEL` mux selected Rc or Rb 




### Example: `ASEL` mux is faulty
Suppose you suspected that the `ASEL` **mux** might be faulty: 
* if `ASEL = 0`, the **output** is always 0. 
* There's no problem if `ASEL = 1`.  
	
{: .note}
> Similarly, note that:
> 1.  The values in the `PC` / Registers in Regfile / Memory Unit will be *different* from a working Beta CPU if these programs were to be executed in this faulty Beta. 
> 2.  You can be 100% sure the discrepancy is caused by  `ASEL` mux being faulty and not any other faults (**isolation**)

Similarly, we assume the initial content of all registers are `0` for this exercise and that `PC` starts from `0`.. We need to write a diagnostic program that requires `ASEl=0`.  This involves all Type 1 arithmetic operation. Consider the following program **P3** to be run at exactly 4 clk cycle (or until `HALT()`, whichever comes earlier):

```cpp 
.=0X000  
CMOVE(8, R1) 
CMOVE(8, R2)
MUL(R1, R2, R0) 
HALT()  
```

The program above can easily detect if the `ASEL` mux is faulty as described by observing the content of `R0` when the program halts. If the Beta CPU is faulty, the content of `R0` will be 0. Otherwise, it will be `64`.

**Explanation**:
* If the `ASEL` mux is faulty, we are multiplying the content of R2 with `0` instead of the content of `R1`
* Hence, the result stored at `R0` will be 0 

Now consider the following program **P4**, to be run at exactly 4 clk cycle (or until `HALT()`, whichever comes earlier):
```cpp
.=0X000  
CMOVE(5, R1) 
LDR(constant, R2) 
MUL(R1, R2, R0) 
HALT()  

constant: LONG(0) 
```

P4 will <span style="color:#ff791a; font-weight: bold;">not</span> be able to detect the fault because the **content** of R0 will be `0` regardless, because `Mem[constant]` that's loaded to `R2` is `0` anyway, and anything multiplied by `0` will have the value of `0`. 


### Example: BOTH `ASEL` & `RA2SEL` muxes are faulty
Now let's try and combine both scenarios where both the `ASEL` and `RA2SEL` muxes are simultaneously faulty as described above, **and** you don't want to waste your time loading and running multiple programs and would like to select one that can **detect both faults**. 

{: .note}
> 1.  You can be 100% sure the discrepancy is caused by **both** `RA2SEL` signal or `ASEL` mux faulty.
> 2.  Programs that can only detect the `RA2SEL` signal faulty but not `ASEL` multiplexer faulty (or vice versa) is **not acceptable**. 

As usual, you can assume that the initial content of all registers are `0` and that `PC` starts from `0`. To detect **both** faults at once, we need a program that **utilises** `ST` as well as Type 1 arithmetic operations that will alter register or memory contents differently than a fully functional Beta CPU. 

Consider the following program **P5** (run for 5 clk cycle):

```cpp
.=0x000  
LDR(constant, R0) 
LDR(constant + 4, R1) 
ADD(R0, R1, R2)  
ST(R2, constant + 8, R31) 
HALT()  

constant: LONG(8)
LONG(4)
```

The content at `Mem[constant+8]` will be 8 instead of 12 if only the `RA2SEL` mux is faulty, and the **content** stored at R2 will be 4 instead of 12 if only the ASEL mux is faulty. 

**Explanation**:
* If the `ASEL` mux is faulty, we will be adding `0` (instead of the content of `R0` which is `8`) with the content of `R1` (which is `4`) and storing it at `R2`. The content of `R2 = 0 + Reg[R1] = 4` instead of the expected `12`.
* `constant` is equivalent to address `24`, or `0x0018`. This makes bit 15 to bit 11 of the `ST` instruction to be `00000`
* If `RA2SEL` mux is faulty, we will be storing the **content** of `R0` (which is `8`) instead of the **content** of `R2` (which might be 4 or 12 depending on whether `ASEL` mux is faulty) 


Now consider another program **P6**, to be run for 5 clk cycles:
```cpp
.=0x0000  
ADDC(R31, 5, R0)  
ST(R0, constant + 8, R31) 
LDR(constant, R1)  
ADD(R1, R1, R2)  
HALT()  

.=0x0BCC  
constant: LONG(8)
LONG(4)
```

Will **P6** be able to detect both faults simultaneously? Why or why not? 

<div cursor="pointer" class="collapsible">Show Answer</div><div class="content_answer"><p>
Yes, <strong>P6</strong> will be able to detect both faults at the same time:
<ul>
<li> The content of <code>R1</code>  is stored to <code>Mem[Constant+8]</code> instead of the content of <code>R0</code>. Therefore, <code>Mem[Constant+8]</code>  is <code>0</code> instead of <code>5</code>.</li>
<li> The content of <code>R2</code> is <code>8</code> instead of <code>16</code>.</li>
</ul>
</p></div><br>

Finally, consider program **P7** below (to be run for 6 clk cycle or until `HALT()`):

```cpp
.=0x000  
constant: LONG(8)
LONG(4)
LDR(constant, R0) 
LDR(constant+4, R1)
ADD(R0, R1, R2) 
ST(R1, .+8, R31) 
HALT()
```

At first glance, the program above seems to be able to detect the faulties just fine. You might think the following:
1. The content of `R0` will be `8` instead of `12` if the `ASEL` mux is faulty, and 
2. The content of `Mem[28]` will be `4` instead of `8` if the `RA2SEL` mux is faulty 

However, since `PC` starts from `0`, the **first** instruction that the CPU will attempt to execute will be `LONG(8)` and **not** `LDR(constant, R0)`. This will trigger a **software interrupt** and therefore `P7` <span style="color:#ff791a; font-weight: bold;">will not</span> be able to immediately isolate either of the faults.

## Summary 
Diagnosing faults in Beta CPU datapath is not an easy task. It requires time and practice, not to mention that you **must** familiarise yourselves with Beta ISA in the first place. [Head to our problem set for more exercise](https://natalieagus.github.io/50002/problemset/betadiagnostics). In the problem set, we will take the **diagnostics** step further by thinking of **alternative** instructions that can be used to replace existing instructions affected by a particular faulty datapath. 

Note that not all faults might have a replacement. For instance, if both `ASEL` and `BSEL` muxes are faulty in the sense that both always output `0` regardless of the input or selector signals, then there's no way to utilise the ALU anymore (which means: we can no longer compute arithmetic instructions anymore, rendering the CPU purposeless).
