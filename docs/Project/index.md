# 50.002 1D & 2D Project
{: .no_toc}

**Duration: Week 1-12**

In this project, you are to design and create an Electronic Hardware Prototype using an FPGA in a group of 5-7 pax.

**Language**: We will provide resources about programming in the hardware design language (HDL) called **[Lucid](https://alchitry.com/tutorials/)**. 
However, you are free to use Verilog if you’re confident, but we will not be able to provide a lot of support for that. Lucid is much simpler than Verilog, it is more than capable to get the job done for this project, hence we chose this as our teaching material. 

**IDE**:  [Alchitry Labs](https://alchitry.com/alchitry-labs/)

**Hardware**: [Alchitry Au (Artix 7 FPGA)](https://alchitry.com/boards/au/). 
This is given in your 1D Kit along with other useful stuffs 

**Tool** (to convert HDL to binary, build your project): [Vivado](https://www.xilinx.com/support/download/index.html/content/xilinx/en/downloadNav/vivado-design-tools.html) 

{:.highlight}
Each group's contact person will need to collect your group’s 1D Kit (containing Alchitry Au FPGA). Refer to your course handout for futher details.
