# Sustainability  Efforts
{: .no_toc}

{:.note}
This is largely related to OBJECTIVE 3. 

Discuss the impact of your project on sustainability, as well as any consideration for diversity and inclusion (e.g., different cultures, abilities, demographic groups, etc.). You may discuss how your project contributes to the [United Nation SDG](/46d00b42548d423d814257e351d62347?pvs=25) wherever applicable. Here are several suggestions.

### **Energy Efficiency**

Challenge yourselves to design your prototype to be as energy-efficient as possible. This could involve optimising the logic to reduce power consumption, using low-power design techniques, or incorporating power management strategies.

### **Use of Recycled Materials**

You are encouraged to use recycled or repurposed materials for the physical components of your prototype. This could include the casing, buttons, or any external peripherals.

### **Longevity and Upgradability**

We encourage designs that are easily upgradable or have a long lifespan, thereby reducing electronic waste. You could focus on modular designs that allow for easy updates or repairs.

### **Reducing Electronic Waste**

Focus on ways to reduce electronic waste either through design, choice of materials, or recycling plans for the end of the product's life.

### **Component Efficiency**

Limit the number of components used in the game to what's essential, encouraging a minimalist approach that reduces waste and resource use.

### **End-of-Life Plan**

Develop a plan for responsibly disposing of or recycling the game components once the project is over.
