Everyone need to complete the Peer Review Rating and Writeup **([rubric](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18zBk5MDIMPpWkZrQDMTH80G4WSlwXeXD/view?usp=sharing)):

- Done via **TEAMMATES** (check your **SUTD** email in Week 12)
- You are to rate **EACH** of your teammates **and yourself** and give each person a rating 0 to 8. You can find the description in the [rubric](#rubric) below.
- If you give anyone a rating lower than 8, you are **expected** to write 30 words (**this** **is** at **minimum, you can write more**) of comments for **each teammate**, **to reason out properly**  on why you gave them such a rating.


The grades that you get for this component is the **average** rating obtained from the rest of your members, rounded **UP** to the nearest **integer.** You may inform your instructors in Week 14 should you have any disputes with the given grade. Instructors are allowed to intervene and adjust the grades accordingly.

## Rubric

| Rating | Title | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Deadweight | Completed 0% of the assigned jobs This is a very special rating reserved for those who contribute NOTHING at all and even give NEGATIVE contribution. In short, it is better if this teammate did not join your group in the first place. |
| 1 | Better-Than-Nothing | Completed about 5%-10% of the assigned jobs. For example, those who only contributed in the first 2-3 weeks of brainstorming, came up with overly ambitious game ideas. Might self-proclaimed as the leader of the team, but then MIA afterwards or did no concrete job. In short: irresponsible. |
| 2 | Bad-Report-Writer | Completed about 10%-30% of the assigned jobs. Came up with many excuses in the second half of the semester, then ended up only doing reports that still need to be corrected by others. Caused a lot of trouble for others in the end because someone had to tank the neglected portion |
| 3 | The Burden | Completed about 30%-40% of the assigned jobs. Suddenly become too busy to work around Week 9. Caused somewhat quite a burden for others in the end because they looked like they have potential in the beginning but someone had to tank their workload. |
| 4 | Chernobyl | Not great, not terrible. Completed about 40-50% of the assigned jobs. Came up with excuses of being busy but managed to work for a little bit more after much pestering. |
| 5 | Could’ve Tried Harder | Have good efforts and good intentions. Completed about 60% of the assigned jobs. Came up with reasonable excuses and kindly ask others to get the job done, then promised to try harder (but never actually did). |
| 6 | The Over Ambitious | Completed most of the assigned jobs (70%). Might be a little too ambitious in the first place, had good intentions but ran out of time to complete everything. Caused the group to have a slightly incomplete project, probably the project is saved last minute by someone else at the cost of their health and sleep. |
| 7 | The Good Member | Completed a good portion of the assigned jobs (80%). Caused the group to have a relatively working project but incomplete hardware parts due to unforeseen circumstances on their part. |
| 8 | MVP | Completed almost all of the assigned jobs (80-100%), or more. Motivated, skilled, and an overall great teammate to have. It is entirely possible to rate everyone in the team as the MVP, if everybody do their assigned jobs properly. |
