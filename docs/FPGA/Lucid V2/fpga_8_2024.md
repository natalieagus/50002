## Debugging Strategies 

This notes contain a collection of debugging strategies depending on the severity of your bugs. Refer to each section depending on your needs. 

## Could not compile the project 

It is **ideal** that you **incrementally** compile your code to ensure that it is compilable (despite running on simulation!). If you already have a large codebase that is not compilable, do the following instead of trying to debug (for the interest of time):
1. Create a **NEW** IO base project 
2. For each module in your project, create it in your new project **with the same interface** only without implementation 
3. Then paste the **implementation of** **ONE** of leaf modules only (the modules that do not instantiate or depend on another module), and test **compile**
4. Once it compiles successfully, repeatedly do (3) until you have no more leaf modules, and then proceed with the next level 

For instance, let's say you have a module with the following dependencies:

```
alchitry_top
├── datapath
│   ├── alu
│   │   ├── boolean
│   │   ├── adder
│   │   ├── shifter
│   │   └── compare
│   ├── regfiles
│   └── control_unit
└── driver
``` 

You shall create **each** module (datapath, alu, etc) but keep the **interface** only (not implementation!): `input`, `output` only. In the always body, set all its output to `0` to silence the errors. You will have something like this, similar to your lab starter code: 

```verilog 
module alu (
    input a[32],
    input b[32],
    input alufn[6],
    output out[32],
    output z,
    output v,
    output n
) {
    
    always {

        out = 0 
        z = 0
        v = 0 
        n = 0    
    }
}
```

Afterwards, paste the implementation of `boolean`, and compile. Once successful, you may proceed with `shifter`, then compile. Repeat this one at a time. Once all leaf modules are successfully compiled (boolean, adder, shifter, compare, regfiles, control_unit), you can begin pasting the implementation of the next level module like `alu` and `datapath`. 

{:.note}
The goal of this protocol is to ensure that the project **compiles**. We do not know at this point if it is functional or not because we have not test it. 


This method is guaranteed to help you pinpoint which module is <span class="orange-bold">problematic</span>. 

### Inspect `runme.log`
Once you found the problematic module, fix it accordingly. You can **open** Vivado log file under `build/vivado/[PROJECT_NAME].runs/impl_1/runme.log` with a text editor and search for `ERROR`. That should give you a clue on what went wrong. If still unsure after reading the errors, **post your question on ed discussion**. 

## Unconstrained Port Error 

This happens when you declare a port in the top module but **did not declare it in the constraint file**. Alchitry Labs should have warned you about it. 

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}//docs/FPGA/Lucid%20V2/images/fpga_8_2024/2025-04-07-10-57-57.png"  class="center_seventy no-invert"/>

This is Alchitry telling you that: *"You said you wanted an output called `data`, but you never told me which physical pins to use on the FPGA!”*. Edit your constraint file to add the corresponding pin. If you don't know what constraint file means, [give this guide a read](https://natalieagus.github.io/50002/fpga/fpga_4_2024). 

## 7 Segment / LED does not light up 

### Test Whether Hardware Works 
You need to first test if your hardware is not damaged by connecting it to VDD and ground on a breadboard with resistor (any resistor is better than nothing, just pick one).  

```
+---------------------- Breadboard ------------------------+
|                                                          |
|  VDD (3.3V or 5V)   GND                                  |
|     |               |                                    |
|     |               |                                    |
|     |               |                                    |
|     |               |                                    |
|     |               |                                    |
|     +--->|──[ R ]───+                                    |
|          LED     330Ω–1kΩ                                |
|                                                          |
|       ↳ Long leg (anode, +) goes to VDD via resistor     |
|       ↳ Short leg (cathode, –) goes to GND               |
+----------------------------------------------------------+

```

You can also use this method to <span class="orange-bold">test</span> individual segments of a 7-segment display, one at a time:
* For common **cathode**, connect the common pin to GND (segment pins to VDD).
* For common **anode**, connect the common pin to VDD (segment pins to GND).

{:.note}
This test also helps you double confirm the function of each pin on your 7segment. 
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/docs/FPGA/Lucid V2/images/ffcaca42580b8a4e7afd6a6f5861614f.jpg"  class="center_thirty"/>

### Test whether GPIO port on FPGA outputs signal properly 

Create a project that drives logic high (1) to **every pin you want to use**. Then connect each GPIO to an LED + Resistor one at a time. 

```
FPGA GPIO pin ───[ 330Ω ]───>│─── GND
                           LED
```

If the LED lights up, you know that pin works fine. 

### Test Static Output 

Once the previous two tests are passed and you know the issue is *not* the hardware nor the GPIO pins, then the issue must be either your *pinout* or *your code* or *both*. Before you start debugging, double check your knowledge by outputting a static value, e.g: turning all LEDs blue, or displaying a fixed digit on your 7segment. 

This ensures that your **pinouts** are correct. Once you are able to output a static value, you can be sure that your hardware, GPIO pins, and knowledge on how to drive the output works fine. This means that **the issue is in your code**. At this point, you might want to spend some time re-implementing certain logic. 

### Test Dynamic Output 

If you reach this step, it means that there's certain flaws in your HDL code. You may want to now display dynamic values to your 7 segment (not your project!). One simple idea is to:
1. Create a `dff` to store binary values from your `io_dip` whenever you press an `io_button` 
2. This `dff` is read by `bin_to_dec` module (if using 7 segment)
3. The output of `bin_to_dec` module drives **both** the internal 7segment and external 7segment
4. Check if the numbers you set from `io_dip` is displayed on the 7segment 
5. If you are just using plain LEDs, check if the LEDs now show the pattern stored in your `dff` 
6. For ease of debugging, also output the content of the `dff` on `io_led` 

{:.important}
Using `io_top` LEDs, dip switches, and buttons ensure that you have a good source of truth, without having to care about wiring connections or pinouts. 

## Code Works on Simulation but not on Hardware: Outputs flickering, Buttons unstable

### Ensure `pulldown` Constraints 

If you observe your code goes *haywire* whenever you hover on `io_button` on the physical FPGA, it is likely that you did not utilise the **pulldown** constraints. [Consult this handout on how to fix it](https://natalieagus.github.io/50002/fpga/fpga_4_2024#pulldown-for-input-pins). 

### Connect Everything to a Common Ground 

If you are powering your LED matrix, 7-segment display, or any external components using a battery or external power supply, you <span class="orange-bold">must</span> connect the ground (GND) of that power source to the FPGA board's ground.

{:.highlight}
> Why?
> 
> Digital signals (like HIGH or LOW) are measured relative to ground. Without a shared ground, the FPGA and external circuit don’t agree on what “0V” means. This can cause unpredictable behavior, no response from the display or potential hardware damage. 

Bottomline: **always connect the external GND to the FPGA GND pin when using external power**.

### Failed to meet timing constraint 

If your project fails timing, that means your design logic is too slow to keep up with the 100 MHz clock (i.e., 10 ns per cycle). Even if Vivado compiles it, the actual hardware may behave unpredictably. You should lower the clock frequency in the constraint file (e.g., set to 10 MHz) so Vivado **checks** for more relaxed timing.

<span class="orange-bold">But remember: the onboard clock is still 100 MHz</span>. You must manually slow your logic (e.g., FSM or output updates) to match this by adding delay logic (like a clock divider). For example: delay each FSM state by 10 times using a counter, so your effective FSM cycle is 1 per microsecond instead of 1 per 10 ns. Give [this page](TBC) a read to find out how. 


{:.important}
Do not attempt to use a project that fails the timing constraint. It might output <span class="orange-bold">unpredictable</span> and non-deterministic behavior.  

## Code Does not Work on Simulation but no Error Reported

The issue might be with your FSM or datapath connection. In order to find out, you need to build a **debug infrastructure**. Consult the [next](#manually-advancing-the-fsm) section. 

## Code Works on Simulation but not on Hardware: FSM does not go to expected state 

{:.warning}
This is the <span class="orange-bold">hardest</span> bug to fix. It is likely that you encounter **timing** issues at this point because simulation does not consider timings. 

In order to *begin* debugging, you need to *write* some kind of debug **infrastructure**. Ideally, you want to have an FSM that:
1. Can be advanced by a button click state by state instead of letting it run, **but** this feature can be easily disabled later on (for final build)
2. Can output all kinds of important signals to `io_led`, such as alu's output, asel/bsel output, wdsel output, or regfile read data output in your 1D project 

### Remove any Division 

Remove code that uses division `/`. Do not use expressions like `a / b` where b is <span class="orange-bold">not</span> a power of 2. 

**Division in hardware is complex**: it requires a divider circuit, which is large, slow, and significantly more complicated than an adder or shifter.

Most hardware division uses restoring or non-restoring algorithms, or iterative subtraction, which take multiple clock cycles. This introduces sequential logic into your ALU, instead of keeping it purely combinational. As a result, it can mess up your timing, increase your critical path delay, and make synthesis and debugging harder.

If you need to divide by a power of 2, use right shifts instead:
- `a >> n` is equivalent to $$\frac{a}{2^n}$$, and is synthesized efficiently with simple wiring logic.

In short: stick to shifts for division, unless you really know what you're doing and have the extra cycles (literally). Once you have done this, recompile the project and test. 

### Ensure Timing Constraint is Met 

Ensure you do not see any warning as such when you compile your project:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}//docs/FPGA/Lucid%20V2/images/fpga_8_2024/2025-04-10-16-35-58.png"  class="center_seventy"/>

If you do, give [this guide](TBC) a read to fix it first (by slowing the clock or slowing the FSM).

### Manually Advancing the FSM 

If none of the above works, you should debug your FSM state-by-state. 

This part is **crucial** for debugging, because it helps you narrow down the problematic states. You can start by using one of the buttons, e.g: `io_button[0]` as an "advance" or "next" button. As usual, pass it through a button conditioner and edge detector: 

```verilog
    // in alchitry_top
    button_conditioner advance_button_conditioner(#CLK_FREQ(CLK_FREQ), .in(io_button[0]))
    edge_detector advance_button_edge(#RISE(1), #FALL(0), .in(advance_button_conditioner.out))

    // if instantiated in other module, simply pass advance_button_edge.out to it 
    game_cu(
        // other port connection
        .fsm_clock(advance_button_edge.out)
    )
```

Then receive the button edge input in your module that contains the game FSM (e.g; the Control Unit module). You then should declare a `sig` to post-process this button press, and prepare a **debug** dff as well as `debug_out` port in this module. The job of the debug output is to indicate *which* state you are currently at. 

```verilog
module game_cu (
    input clk,  // clock
    input rst,  // reset
    input fsm_clock, 
    // other ports
    ...

    output state_debug_out[8] 
){
    // module instantiation 
    // other modules here 

    dff debug[8](.clk(clk), .rst(rst), #INIT(0))
    sig advance 

    always{
        advance = fsm_clock
        debug.d = debug.q
        state_debug_out = debug.q 

        // other code
    }
}

```

In the FSM implementation, set `debug.d` into different combination depending on the states we are in, and set the FSM to go to next state only when `advance == 1`. For instance:

```verilog
    States.SET_POINTS: 
        alufn = b011010 // "A" 
        asel = b10 // Decimal 1
        wdsel = b000 // Route ALU's output
        regfile_wa = d4 
        if(advance){
            regfile_we = 1
            game_fsm.d = States.RESET_TIMER                    
        }
        debug.d = 8d2 // unique debug signal when we are at SET_POINTS

    States.RESET_TIMER: 
        
        alufn = b011010 // "A" 
        asel = b11 // Decimal 25 
        wdsel = b000 // Route ALU's output    
        
        regfile_wa = d1 
        if(advance){
            regfile_we = 1 
            game_fsm.d = States.SPAWN_MOLE
        }
        debug.d = 8d4 // unique debug signal when we are at `RESET_TIMER`
```

{:.warning}
It is important that `regfile_we` or any write enable signal is put under the `advance` clause as shown above. This is because we **do not want** our regfile to be repeatedly overwritten. 

The following state will <span class="orange-bold">not</span> work as expected if `regfile_we` is put outside the if block: 

```verilog
    States.UPDATE_SCORE:
        alufn = b000000 //  +
        regfile_ra1 = d3 // currentScore dff 
        regfile_ra2 = d4 // scoreToAdd dff 
        asel = b00 // select rd1
        bsel = b00 // select rd2
        regfile_we = 1 // WRONG! we should NOT be outside advance  
        regfile_wa = d3 // currentScore dff
        if(advance){
            game_fsm.d = States.RESET_TIMER
            
        }
        debug.d = 8d8
```

Since `advance` will only be `1` if we press the `io_button`, then we will loop at this state for millions of loops before we press the `advance` button. We will end up <span class="orange-bold">repeatedly</span> adding the content of `currentScore` dff with `scoreToAdd` dff for a million times. Your final score will not reflect the true value at this state.

Instead, do this: 

```verilog
    States.UPDATE_SCORE:
        alufn = b000000 //  +
        regfile_ra1 = d3 // currentScore dff 
        regfile_ra2 = d4 // scoreToAdd dff 
        asel = b00 // select rd1
        bsel = b00 // select rd2
        regfile_wa = d3 // currentScore dff
        if(advance){
            regfile_we = 1 // CORRECT! write ONCE only when advance is 1
            game_fsm.d = States.RESET_TIMER   
        }
        debug.d = 8d8
```

{:.highlight}
This ensured that we are only writing to the regfile **once**, that is in the clock cycle where `advance` is `1`. 

With this setup, you should be able to now manually advance your FSM with a click of a button. 

#### The IDLE State: leave as-is

Howevere you cannot do this in the state where you are waiting for *another* button edge press, or some slow clock edge. One example would be the `IDLE` state or some kind of `WAIT_INPUT` state.  For instance, do **not** add the advance button functionality on either of these states:

```verilog
            States.START: 
                if (start_button_edge_pressed) {
                    game_fsm.d = States.INITIALIZE
                }
                
                else {
                    game_fsm.d = States.START
                }
                debug.d = 8d1

            States.IDLE: // wait for input
                debug.d = 8d5
                if (decrease_timer) {
                    game_fsm.d = States.CHECK_TIMER
                }
                
                else if (button_p1_edge_pressed) {  
                    regfile_we = 1
                    regfile_wa = d2 
                    wdsel_out = b010 
                    game_fsm.d = States.REGISTER_P1_MOVE
                }

                else if (button_p2_edge_pressed) {  
                    regfile_we = 1
                    regfile_wa = d3
                    wdsel_out = b010 
                    game_fsm.d = States.REGISTER_P2_MOVE
                } 

                else {
                    game_fsm.d = States.IDLE   
                }
            
```

This is because you won't be able to press two buttons exactly at the same clock cycle. If you do the `START` state as such, you might never be able to go to the `INITIALIZE` state very easily. 

```verilog
    States.START: 
        if (start_button_edge_pressed) {
            if (advance) game_fsm.d = States.INITIALIZE // very unlikely to happen
        }
        
        else {
            game_fsm.d = States.START
        }
        debug.d = 8d1
```


### Display All Crucial Information 

Once you are able to make your FSM advance manually using button presses, you need to create an infrastructure in `alchitry_top` so that you can **inspect** all sort of signal values in that particular states. You can utilise `io_dip` for this, just like how we set the output to debug [Lab 4: Beta](https://natalieagus.github.io/50002/lab/lab4#output-signals). You should inspect **all kinds** of crucial signals: the output of asel/bsel, the output of wdsel, output of ALU, output of important dffs, etc. 

For instance, your datapath module should output the following (and more):

```verilog
module game_datapath (
    input clk,  // clock
    input rst,  // reset
    
    // input and output of datapath 
    
    // debug output
    output p1_score_dff_debug[16],
    output p2_score_dff_debug[16],
    output rd1_out_debug[16],
    output rd2_out_debug[16],
    output current_timer_dff_debug[16],
    output alu_out_debug[16],
    output wdsel_out_debug[16],
    output bsel_out_debug[16],
    output asel_out_debug[16],
    output control_signals_debug[16], // asel(3) bsel(3) wdsel(3) ra1(3) ra2(3), ignore MSB
    output state_out_debug[16]
    
) {
 // implementation
}
```

You would need to create **intermediary** signals to route it **both** to output and the corresponding module. For example:

```verilog 
    sig asel_out[32]

    // in always body
        case(control_system.asel){
            b0:
                asel_out = regfile_system.rd1
            b1:
                asel_out = 32d30 // constant 30
            default:
                asel_out = regfile_system.rd1
        }

        // hook it up to the output port 
        asel_out_debug = asel_out

        // also connect it to alu  
        alu.a = asel_out 
```

Do not do the following: 

```verilog
        // HARD TO DEBUG!
        case(control_system.asel){
            b0:
                alu.a = regfile_system.rd1
            b1:
                alu.a = 32d30 // constant 30
            default:
                alu.a = regfile_system.rd1
        }

```
{:.highlight}
Consult Lab 4: Beta code for inspiration. 

Then in alchitry_top, utilize the dip switches to show different debug values. For instance:

```verilog
case (io_dip[0]){

            h00:
                io_led[1:0] = $build(datapath.state_out_debug, 2)
                seg.values = $build(datapath.state_out_debug, 4)
            h01: 
                io_led[1:0] = $build(datapath.asel_out_debug, 2)
                seg.values = $build(datapath.asel_out_debug, 4)
            h02: 
                io_led[1:0] = $build(datapath.bsel_out_debug, 2)
                 seg.values = $build(datapath.bsel_out_debug, 4)
            h03: 
                io_led[1:0] = $build(datapath.wdsel_out_debug, 2)
                seg.values = $build(datapath.wdsel_out_debug, 4)
            h04: 
                io_led[1:0] = $build(datapath.alu_out_debug, 2)
                seg.values = $build(datapath.alu_out_debug, 4)
            h05: 
                io_led[1:0] = $build(datapath.rd2_out_debug, 2)
                seg.values = $build(datapath.rd2_out_debug, 4)
            ...
           // and so on, for each of debug signal from datapath  

    }
```

### Build and Debug 

With the debug infrastructure in place, you can safely **trace** the error both on simulation (if you didn't use any BRAM) and on the hardware. This will give you a clue whether:
1. Are any states problematic? (did not go to the right state in hardware but go to the right state in simulation)
2. Is a particular state triggered? (useful to check if simulation does not work either) 

### Debug: Replace the ALU (Temporarily)

Once you have identified the problematic state, you can temporarily replace your ALU with [instructor ALU](https://github.com/natalieagus/sample-1d-project-alchitry-v2/blob/main/source/alu.luc) and see if the problem persists. 

### Debug: Use Lucid Operators Directly in a State (Temporarily)

In a problematic state, you may try to use Lucid Operators directly such as (assume control unit directly gets RD2 from regfile):

```
    States.CHECK_PRESS_P1:
                    
        regfile_ra2 = d0 // P1 button press
        
        if(regfile_rd2_out < 3){ // use lucid operator, bypass ALU 
            game_fsm.d = States.INCREASE_SCORE_P1
        }
        else{
            game_fsm.d = States.IDLE // ignore button press
        }
        debug.d = 8d6
```

## Some States (not all) does not Transition as Expected 

It is likely that you have violated timing constraints if the code works on simulation but fails on actual FPGA. Give this page a read to either slow down the input `clk` or slow your FSM while still using the default 100MHz clock. 

## Display Matrix Does not Work 

You need to first ensure that your game logic is solid on **both** hardware (io top) and simulation. Once you have done this, you might realise that your display matrix did not display what you wanted. The issue might either be in your hardware or your driver. 

First, check that your matrix works using instructor's driver demo ([WS2812B](https://natalieagus.github.io/50002/fpga/fpga_6_2024) or [HUB75](https://natalieagus.github.io/50002/fpga/fpga_7_2024) style matrix). The code should work **as-is** without any modification. 

If it does not work, then **check your connection**, or it is likely that your hardware has spoiled. You might need to purchase a backup hardware. 

Otherwise, if it works, then you would need to slowly trace your code again and ensure it outputs the right thing. Consider the following infrastructure that highlights **separation of concern**. 

```
[Datapath] ---> (writes) ---> [Display Buffer] ---> (reads) ---> [Display Driver] ---> [LED Matrix]
```

### Create a Display Buffer
Use a dedicated register (DFF) or memory module (e.g., BRAM, `simple_ram`, or `simple_dual_ram`) to act as a display buffer. This module's only purpose is to store the current screen state, <span class="orange-bold">nothing more</span>.

### Display Driver: Read-Only Access
The display driver should only read from the display buffer. It should never perform logic or calculations. Think of it as a "dumb" renderer, it simply reads what's in the buffer and sends it to the display hardware.

## Datapath: Write-Only Access
Your logic (Datapath) should only write to the display buffer. All computations happen elsewhere typically in your REGFILE or control logic. The display buffer just holds the final output to be shown.

This separation of concerns makes your design easier to debug and reason about and avoids conflicts between components trying to read/write the same data at the same time.





## Summary 

These debug strategies generally work to catch any bug with your 50.002 1D project within a reasonable time, but they are not magic tools. Debugging HDL requires patience and discipline. Sometimes, it might be easier to remake the project from scratch and does **incremental test** (both on simulator and hardware). Good luck!
