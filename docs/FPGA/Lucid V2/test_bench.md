## Test Bench 

This document is written to guide you with debugging the FPGA using **Alchitry Labs V2 Test Bench**.  Using test bench is way faster than building and flashing into the FPGA, and is able to display more information than the simulation HUD.

## Creating a test bench 

To start create a test bench modules under the create file tab:
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}//docs/FPGA/Lucid%20V2/images/test_bench_images/Pasted image 20250417192506.png"  class="center_fifty no-invert"/>




It should create a new file under your source files. And when opened it looks something like this:
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}//docs/FPGA/Lucid%20V2/images/test_bench_images/Pasted image 20250417192745.png"  class="center_seventy no-invert"/>

In Alchitry Lab v2 there are functions that can only be used in test bench modules. These are very useful for debugging. The [source document]( https://alchitry.com/tutorials/lucid-reference) can be found here. 

| Function                   | Argument Type                                                                                                                                                     | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

## How to use

### Basic Usage

The best way to use test bench is to use it on **each individual modules** you create be it  the adder, multiplier or any custom modules you  plan to use. The purpose of test bench is to make sure your modules work as expected before integrating into your data path.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}//docs/FPGA/Lucid%20V2/images/test_bench_images/Pasted image 20250417194003.png"  class="center_fifty no-invert"/>

To test, implements your module like how you would in a normal lucid file with the required **PARAMETER** and assign their **INPUT** and **OUTPUT**:
- Instatiate your module as shown below
- Create a test file 
- Set the inputs to your module
- Then call the `$tick()` function to **propagate signal changes**, this is like waiting long enough to capture the output of your module

Once you fully implement the your test modules (no error detected), a play button should appear at the top of the test block. Which means that your test bench is ready to run.
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}//docs/FPGA/Lucid%20V2/images/test_bench_images/Pasted image 20250417195100.png"  class="center_fifty no-invert"/>

Once  Alchitry Lab has finished loading your test case, it will open a new tab with the expected output. 
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}//docs/FPGA/Lucid%20V2/images/test_bench_images/Pasted image 20250417195337.png"  class="center_seventy no-invert"/>

On the graph, if you hover your mouse, you can see your values of the **INPUT** and **OUTPUT** ports as well as the values in a **SIGNAL** and **DFF** at the first clock cycle. 

{:.note}
With this method using `$tick`, you can propagate signals to your modules to check if the given input values are returning the **correct** expect outputs. The downside is: you need to **manually** check the output and potentially see if there is any error when with the logic. 

#### Advancing clock cycle
If you want to test sequential logic device, you need to advance to the next several clock cycles to check if your DFF is storing/outputting the correct values in the modules.  

The best way to do so is to use the `tick_clock` function provided by the template. We can call this function several times to mimmick multiple clock cycle advancement. For example, suppose we want to advance the system by 2 clock cycles, hence we can write `$tick_clock()` twice under the test block. 


<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}//docs/FPGA/Lucid%20V2/images/test_bench_images/Pasted image 20250417201608.png"  class="center_seventy no-invert"/>



{:.note}
We can change `silent_tick` to `tick` if we want to see the output graph too at CLK = 0. 

If we run the test block, we can now see 2 clock cycle outputs. As you can see on the first cycle the `dff store` takes in input `7` while the output remains at `0`. Only on the second cycle , `dff store` is outputting the stored value `7`. 

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}//docs/FPGA/Lucid%20V2/images/test_bench_images/Pasted image 20250417202306.png"  class="center_seventy no-invert"/>

We can actually run **multiple** test cases in one go too by separating each test case with the  `tick_clock` function. 

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}//docs/FPGA/Lucid%20V2/images/test_bench_images/Pasted image 20250417204225.png"  class="center_fifty no-invert"/>

With this you should be able to use test bench for testing any modules. Each time, you need to **manually** confirm with the graph that your module outputs the correct expected value. 


### Advance Usage

In test bench modules, there are 3 more (advanced) built-in functions that can be used to automatically check the output of your module.

| Function | Argument Type | Purpose | 
| `$assert(expr)`            | Any expression, typically a [comparison](https://alchitry.com/tutorials/lucid-reference/#comparison).                                                             | Checks that `expr` is non-zero (true). If it is zero the simulation is halted and an error is printed indicating the failed assert.                                                                                                       |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `$print(expr)`             | Any expression                                                                                                                                                    | Prints the value of `expr`. If `expr` is a [string literal](https://alchitry.com/tutorials/lucid-reference/#strings), it prints the string. Otherwise, it prints `expr = value` where `expr` is the text and `value` is the actual value. |
| `$print(format, exprs...)` | `format` is a [string literal](https://alchitry.com/tutorials/lucid-reference/#strings) and `exprs` is a variable number of expressions depending on the `format` | Prints the string `format` with the values of the provided `exprs` replaced where applicable. Valid format flags are `%d` for decimal, `%h` for hex, `%b` for binary, `%nf` for fractional where `n` is the number of fractional bits.    |

### `$assert(expr)`

This function will halt execution if the output is not as expected. 

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}//docs/FPGA/Lucid%20V2/images/test_bench_images/Pasted image 20250417215400.png"  class="center_seventy no-invert"/>

The clock cycle only advances only once even though the `tick_clock` function was called 3 times because the `$assert` function after the first cycle halt the clock fails to pass the check. 

### `$print(expr)`

For `$print`, you can use them like how you would use them in python or java, where you can print a string or any output value. The printed statement would appear in the terminal below.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}//docs/FPGA/Lucid%20V2/images/test_bench_images/Pasted image 20250417215831.png"  class="center_seventy no-invert"/>

### `print(format, exprs...)`

For `$print` with format, it allows you to format and variable into a print statement just like in any programming language.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}//docs/FPGA/Lucid%20V2/images/test_bench_images/Pasted image 20250417220241.png"  class="center_thirty no-invert"/>


### Creating custom functions

To create custom test function we use the `fun` syntax like the provided `fun tick_clock()` . 

We can create a simple function like this just to test your module's outputs:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}//docs/FPGA/Lucid%20V2/images/test_bench_images/Pasted image 20250417222547.png"  class="center_seventy no-invert"/>


We can also create a useful helper functions that can be used for multiple modules. For instance, a function that concatenates two 5-bit values then assign to signal `a` and `b` of the adder module. You can use the `repeat` function like a for loop in test bench **IF** you include a clock advancement in the repeat function: 

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}//docs/FPGA/Lucid%20V2/images/test_bench_images/Pasted image 20250417225419.png"  class="center_seventy no-invert"/>

Another useful but simple function you can use is one that will advance the clock cycle by a specified amout: 

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}//docs/FPGA/Lucid%20V2/images/test_bench_images/Pasted image 20250417230034.png"  class="center_thirty no-invert"/>

You can just utilise this function instead of writing a bunch of `$tick_clock` every time.  

## Debugging & Tips for Test Bench

This section is written to tackle any bugs you might have met while writing test files: 

- Make sure all other lucid modules **do not** have error (highlighted red), else the run button will not show up

- If you want to use the output value of a module make sure to capture it after clock advancement, *not before;* else your output value would be 1 cycle behind
    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}//docs/FPGA/Lucid%20V2/images/test_bench_images/Pasted image 20250417230931.png"  class="center_fifty no-invert"/>

- If the terminal is stuck at running test bench, just close and reopen Alchitry Lab, it should not take more than a few seconds to run. Unless you advance the clock more than 20 times, then it will start to slow down. 

- You can **simulate** button presses by assigning its input to `1` in the current  cycle and `0` the next cycle
    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}//docs/FPGA/Lucid%20V2/images/test_bench_images/Pasted image 20250417232103.png"  class="center_fifty no-invert"/>

-  When creating a function, remember to add the bit size for your arguments.

## Summary

This guide explains how to use test bench modules in Alchitry Lab v2 to efficiently debug Lucid designs without needing to flash the FPGA. Test benches allow you to simulate modules individually, inspect signal values across clock cycles, and use powerful built-in functions like `$tick()`, `$assert()`, and `$print()` for debugging and validation. You can run multiple test cases, create custom functions for repeated checks, and visualize behavior using waveform outputs. This method greatly speeds up development by enabling quick iteration and detailed introspection of logic, making it ideal for verifying modules before integration into a full datapath.
