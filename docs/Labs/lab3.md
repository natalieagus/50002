# Lab 3: Clocked Circuits
{: .no_toc}


## Objectives

### Submission
Complete the Lab 3 **checkoff** (2%) with your Cohort TA before the next lab session ends. The checkoff is assessed **individually**, but you should attend together with your **project team** so that everyone in the group understands the full workflow and expectations for the 1D project.

Complete **questionnaire** on eDimension as well (2%).

### Starter Code
There's no starter code for this lab. You simply need to have [Alchitry Labs V2](https://alchitry.com/alchitry-labs/) installed. You don't need Vivado for this lab, we are only going to run simulations. 

## Related Class Materials
The lecture notes on **[sequential logic](https://natalieagus.github.io/50002/notes/sequential logic)** are closely related to this lab.
