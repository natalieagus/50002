## [Overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkVIr8jrtX0&t=0s)

One of the cheapest ways to encode information in terms of 0s and 1s is using    voltage levels, illustrated in the diagram below. 

<img src="/50002/assets/contentimage/notes_b/1.png"  class="center_seventy"/>

This is how digital circuits work. This method of determining *discrete* values out of analog voltage (which value is originally made up of real number, and therefore *continuous* and *infinite*) is called the **digital abstraction**. We need to find a way to determine **digital** signal values out of analog voltage values. 

What are the benefits of the digital abstraction?
1.  The digital abstraction is where one interprets voltage values as **binary** values, thus allowing us to encode information using voltages.
2.  Using voltages to encode bits of 0's and 1's provides a **cheap and stable way** for us to exchange information through digital devices.
3.  We can also **manipulate** or **change** information encoded using voltages very easily.

The voltages that represent digital bits are generated by **semiconductor devices (MOSFET)** -- something that we will learn in the next chapter. The benefit of using semiconductors  the ease of generation, and that they require zero power in steady-state. The drawbacks however, is that the voltages generated by these semiconductors are easily affected by external disturbances,  and hence they may be unstable.

To preserve the integrity of information encoded in digital devices made of semiconductor materials, we need to **set some contracts between these interconnected digital devices**. In this notes, we are going to learn *how* we can use voltages to encode information in a stable way that follows a particular contract called the    **static discipline**  to guarantee the behavior of each processing block in the system.

  
## [A Digital Processing Element: Combinational Device and Combinational Digital System](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkVIr8jrtX0&t=255s)

A digital device is any device that uses voltages to encode information in terms of “low voltage” **(bit 0)** and “high voltage” **(bit 1)**. Its output is a pure function of the present input only *(there's no memory of past inputs)*, and it has the following criteria.

A combinational device is a specific type of digital device that has the following criteria:
1.  One or more digital inputs
2.  One or more digital outputs
3.  A **functional specification** that details the value of each output for each possible **combination** of inputs (can be illustrated in terms of truth table / boolean expression)
	> Its circuit performs an operation assigned logically by a boolean expression or truth table.

4. A **timing specification** consisting of an upper bound required propagation time for the device to compute the specified output values given a set of valid and stable input value(s)

Later on you will learn another type of digital logic devices called the **sequential** logic device, whose output depends not only on the present input but also on the history of the inputs, hence having a *memory*. 

A **set** of interconnected circuit elements is  **combinational** and can be labeled as a **combinational digital system** if and only if:
* **Each circuit element is also combinational with no directed cycles** (no *feedback* loop), and 
* That very device's input is connected to **exactly one output of another device** or to some vast supply of `0`s and `1`s.

  
## [Voltage to encode information](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkVIr8jrtX0&t=438s)

The most naive way to use voltage to encode information is to use ‘low’ voltage to encode valid ‘0’ and ‘high’ voltage to encode valid ‘1’, and define the low and high threshold for each valid ‘0’ and ‘1’.

Anything that is between the low and high threshold value is called the invalid zone, as shown in the figure below:

> The values of operating voltage in practice is commonly set to be 0.3V for low voltage and 3.3V for high voltage. 
  
## [The Static Discipline](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkVIr8jrtX0&t=634s)
The static discipline is one of the **contracts** bound for all logical elements making up a digital system. The static discipline is stated as follows:

  

> **A digital system must be able to produce a valid output (for the next device connected at its output terminal) according to its specification if it is given a valid input.**

This contract **guarantees** the behavior for each processing block in a system, so that a set of such interconnected devices may work properly (are able to pass and compute valid information at the end of the chain of connections). This is necessary so that the system has a **predictable behavior.**

> **However this doesn't mean that the opposite is true**. A device that receives invalid input *does NOT always have to* produce invalid output. **We cannot determine the output of the combinational logic device IF invalid input is given**. Recall that you need to add a **pulldown** resistor at each input for your Mini Hardware Project to give a valid `0` when the switch is **open**. That is because without the pulldown resistor, the input will not be connected to anything (open wire) and this will supply an **invalid input**, resulting in an **undetermined or unpredictable** output for your MHP. In a nutshell, we don't care much and cannot define or guarantee the behaviour of the combinational device if it receives invalid input -- it may or may not produce a valid output.


Therefore, one can say that **a combinational logic device always obeys the static discipline**. 


  

## [Voltage Specifications and Noise Margin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkVIr8jrtX0&t=488s)


Consider two digital devices connected in series as shown in the figure below. These devices are called a **buffer**, meaning that they pass the same bit over (if it receives a low voltage, it will produce a low voltage and vice versa). If we were to *naively decide* that any voltage below $$V_{low}$$=`0.5V` as digital bit `0`, and any voltage above $$V_{high}$$=`2.5V` as digital bit `1`, then our device **may violate the static discipline.** 

>*Why is this so?*

<img src="https://dropbox.com/s/9lejkhiqx50ga8y/p4.png?raw=1"    style="width: 80%;" >

This explanation can be made clear with the following example. Suppose we supply 0.5V and Device 1 is able to produce also 0.5V, which means digital bit . 
* However, the problem is that a *wire*, that connects two or more combinational devices together is susceptible to **noise**. 
* The voltage value that is received at Device 2 may be *slightly higher* than 0.5V, for example: 0.55V instead, and therefore according to our specification, it is *no longer a valid bit `0`*.

> *Note that a noise can knock the voltage down as well, this is just an example that's detrimental to the function of the devices in this example.*

  
Device 1 in the figure above **violates** static discipline because given a **valid** input, it may be **unable** to produce a valid output (to **reach** the next device 2), because the `0.5V` produced at the output of Device 1 may meet some disturbances that caused it to be slightly off, e.g: `0.55V`.

Hence, we need to account for the presence of some light **noise**. Instead of naively setting some voltage $$V_{high}$$ and $$V_{low}$$ as we did above, we need to set a *range* of Voltages as valid bit `1` and `0` respectively and need to have something called the **noise margin** to tolerate noise. It is illustrated as the yellow region in the Figure below. The noise margin is formed by setting *four* Voltage specifications:  $$V_{ol}$$, $$V_{oh}$$, $$V_{il}$$, $$V_{ih}$$, where  $$V_{ol}$$< $$V_{il}$$< $$V_{ih}$$ < $$V_{oh}$$ which **defines** what range of voltage values signifies a **valid** digital bit  and a **valid** digital bit `0` *for any combinational logic component in the system*: 
  
<img src="https://dropbox.com/s/pt0n36pmy9ncyc6/Volt_2.png?raw=1"     >

>    The *noise margin* adds as a **precaution** against external disturbances (noise). 

Below are the explanations necessary to understand the figure above:
1.  $$V_{ol}$$ (voltage output low) and $$V_{oh}$$ (voltage output high) is the voltage that **your system** outputs, depending on whether your system is outputting bit `0` or `1`. The output of this system is going to be received by another system after traversing through some wire.

 
2.  $$V_{il}$$ (voltage input low) or $$V_{ih}$$ (voltage input high) is the voltage that **your system** receives as **input** from another system.

3.  The **absolute difference** between $$V_{ol}$$ and $$V_{il}$$ is called the **low bit noise margin**, and the **absolute difference** between $$V_{oh}$$ and $$V_{ih}$$ is called the **high bit noise margin**.
	> Noise margin is formally defined as the **maximum** voltage amplitude of *extraneous* (erronous) signal that can be added to the noise-free input level *without* causing a drastic change in the output voltage and that it is still within the valid logic level. 

4.  The **noise immunity** (like an "overall" or "effective" noise margin) is the ***minimum*** between the high bit noise margin and the low bit noise margin.

5.  $$V_{ol}$$ is **less** than $$V_{il}$$, because we would want to have some *buffer* against noise. A device always outputs a lower voltage value to signify digital bit `0``0` and accepts a slightly higher low-voltage value as digital bit `0``0`. The same logic applies for the higher region as well, as $$V_{oh}$$ is greater than $$V_{ih}$$

  

6.  In our previous case earlier, if $$V_{ol}$$ is set to be `0.5V`, and $$V_{il}$$ is set to be `0.6V`, then *Device 2*  will be able to **tolerate** up to `0.1V` of noise (if any). Therefore, `0.55V` in our example above is still '*seen*' as a valid bit `0` when it arrives at the input terminal of Device 2, thus making Device 1 ***obeys the static discipline.***


Once **set and chosen,** these four voltage specifications: $$V_{ol}$$, $$V_{oh}$$, $$V_{il}$$, and $$V_{ih}$$ are to be obeyed by every digital **device in an entire combinational logic circuit**.

  

## [Voltage Transfer Characteristic Function (VTC)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkVIr8jrtX0&t=974s)

The VTC is a **plot** between the input voltage ($$V_{in}$$) to a digital system/device vs the output voltage ($$V_{out}$$) of this digital system.

>  VTC **does not** tell us how fast the device is. It just captures the static behavior of the device and tells us what *kind* of device it is.

The image below shows the VTC of a **buffer**: a *low* $$V_{in}$$ gives a *low* $$V_{out}$$ and vice versa. 

<img src="https://dropbox.com/s/vod5ltqh4kq9119/vtcbuffer.png?raw=1"   width="60%" alt ="Figure 4"/>

> What will the VTC of an inverter look like? 


The purpose of plotting a VTC (*typically obtained from device measurements, i.e: we supply input voltages at intervals and measure the output*) helps us to **determine** whether or not a digital device **can be used** as a combinational logic device. 

> In other words, to find out if we can find a set of four voltage specifications: $$V_{ol}$$, $$V_{oh}$$, $$V_{il}$$, and $$V_{ih}$$ for the device so that **the device obeys the static discipline**.

Explanation of the VTC figure above:
- The red zone is called the **forbidden zone**. It is formed by the four voltage specifications: $$V_{ol}$$, $$V_{oh}$$, $$V_{il}$$, and $$V_{ih}$$ that we set for the entire system. <br>
- The name *'forbidden zone'* comes from the fact that  any value within this zone means that the device receives **valid** input but is unable to produce a valid output hence **violating the static discipline** and cannot be used as a combinational logic device.

You can quickly tell if a digital device can be *potentially* be used as a combinational logic device **iff**: you can **find** a set of these four voltage specifications: $$V_{ol}$$, $$V_{oh}$$, $$V_{il}$$, and $$V_{ih}$$ **whereby its VTC curve  does not cross the forbidden zone** and that $$V_{ol}$$< $$V_{il}$$ < $$V_{ih}$$ < $$V_{oh}$$.
* We typically begin by *guessing* each value of $$V_{ol}$$, $$V_{oh}$$, $$V_{il}$$, and $$V_{ih}$$ and check if the curve crosses the forbidden zone (check if static discpline obeyed) formed by these four values. 

* If static discipline is violated, we either adjust our guess or find another device. 
* Also, we want to choose  $$V_{ol}$$, $$V_{oh}$$, $$V_{il}$$, and $$V_{ih}$$ that **maximises noise immunity**. -

If you can satisfy the condition highlighted above, then it means that the device is a combinational logic device. It's VTC curve has to possesses both **characteristics** below:

1.  There exist *some region in the VTC* whereby   its **absolute** `Gain` is $$>1$$ . `Gain` is actually a function of $$V_{in}$$ and is **formally** defined as: 

	$$\begin{aligned}
	\text{Gain}(V_{in}) = \frac{d V_{out}}{d V_{in}} \end{aligned}$$

	In laymen terms you can approximate `Gain` during some transition $$V_{in_i}$$ to $$V_{in_j}$$ that results in some $$V_{out_k}$$ to $$V_{out_l}$$ respectively by the simply computing the slope between these two points on the VTC: 
	
	$$ \text{Gain} \approx \frac{V_{out_l}-V_{out_k}}{V_{in_j}-V_{in_i}}  $$

	If you have found four voltage specifications $$V_{ol}$$, $$V_{oh}$$, $$V_{il}$$, and $$V_{ih}$$ for which the device still obeys the static discipline, you can **approximate** device's maximum `Gain` by computing: 

	$$\max\text{Gain}\approx \frac{V_{oh} - V_{ol}}{ V_{ih} - V_{il}}$$


1.  If  absolute `Gain` $$>1$$, then there is a **finite, positive** noise margin. If absolute `Gain`$$=1$$, then there's **zero** noise margin. It is *impossible* to have absolute `Gain` $$<1$$ and still have the four Voltage specifications $$V_{ol}$$ < $$V_{il}$$ < $$V_{ih}$$ < $$V_{oh}$$.
	  
	  > You might want to ponder a little and convince yourself why the statement above is true. 

	   Also, having absolute `Gain > 1` **maintains** the signal passed through the system as signal loss is inevitable through the system.

2. The device has a  **Non-linear `Gain`**, meaning that `Gain`  is a **function** of `Vin` and therefore the *gradient* along the *entire* curve varies. 
	* The VTC curve for a combinational logic device should not be **entirely** made of a single, constant gradient like the shape of a plot from a basic line equation, but rather more towards an "S" (or mirrored S) shape.

	> In other words, if both characteristics above aren't satisfied in the VTC curve, then it is not the VTC of a combinational logic device.

## [Summary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkVIr8jrtX0&t=1290s)
[You may want to watch the post lecture videos here.](https://youtu.be/3OoeuqWDhns)

In this chapter, we have learned about the digital abstraction, that is how can we set some **contracts** (via setting the four voltage specifications) such that we can establish digital values out of real-valued voltages. 

In the next chapter, we will learn about the **MOSFET** (transistor), that is one of the smallest component (building block) that makes up a digital device, and how we can use them to form a proper combinational logic elements we call **gates**. These **gates** can be  used to form an even larger **combinational circuits** such as the **adder**, **shifter**, etc, and an even larger one such as the **Arithmetic Logic Unit** (you will build them in Lab 2 and 3). 

> Each larger device will provide greater level of *abstraction*.  

Therefore, it is imperative that each  combinational logic device / component, no matter how small, **must** conform to the static discipline and the established four voltage specifications (that must be chosen such that it fits with their VTC) so that the larger system can work as intended.
